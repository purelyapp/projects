# Getting Started with Purely Development

Welcome to Purely Development! This guide will help you get up and running with our development template and understand how to use it effectively.

## 🎯 What is Purely Development?

Purely Development is our team's standardized template for all new development projects. It ensures:

- **Consistency** - All projects follow the same structure and patterns
- **Quality** - Built-in best practices and automated quality checks
- **Efficiency** - Pre-configured tools and workflows
- **Collaboration** - Standardized processes for team collaboration

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git configured
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Access to our team's repositories

### 1. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd purely-development-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
cd template
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Vercel Configuration (if using Vercel MCP)
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
VERCEL_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
```

### 4. Database Setup

```bash
# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed with sample data (optional)
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

## 📁 Understanding the Structure

### Template Directory (`/template`)

This is your main application directory. It contains:

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `__tests__/` - Test files
- `supabase/` - Database migrations and seeds
- `public/` - Static assets

### MCP Servers

- `supabase-mcp-server/` - Handles database operations
- `vercel-mcp-server/` - Handles deployment automation

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a New Feature

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... code ...

# Test your changes
npm run test

# Lint your code
npm run lint

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
```

### 2. Code Standards

Follow these standards for consistency:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write tests for new functions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow the existing file structure

### 3. Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### 4. Building and Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

Our template includes AI agent integration through Cursor. The AI agent can:

- Generate code following our standards
- Run tests automatically
- Create pull requests
- Update documentation
- Deploy applications

### Cursor Rules

The AI agent follows these rules:

- Always use TypeScript
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write comprehensive tests
- Add proper error handling
- Update documentation when needed

4. Explore the example components in `/template/components`

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you run into issues:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md)
2. Search existing issues in the repository
3. Ask for help in team channels
4. Create a new issue if needed
